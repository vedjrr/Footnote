# Footnote: progress

The shared memory between agent sessions. Every session reads the current
state and the last three log entries before doing anything, and writes one
entry before stopping.

## Current state

Rewrite this block at every handoff. Keep it under 25 lines. It is shown to
each new session automatically, so it must be enough to start from.

<!-- STATE:START -->
- Last finished task: none
- Next task: T00 Preflight: repository, identity, hooks, tooling
- In progress: nothing
- Build: no code yet
- Evals: not run
- Blocked on Ved: nothing
- Watch out for: nothing yet
- Updated: not yet
<!-- STATE:END -->

## How to write a log entry

- Newest entry first, directly under the "Log" heading.
- One entry per session. Never edit or delete an older entry; if it was wrong,
  say so in a new one.
- At most 30 lines. Facts, not a story. Someone with no context must be able
  to act on it.
- Outcome is one of: done, partial, blocked.
- Under "Verified", give the commands you ran and what they printed that
  matters (counts, pass or fail). Write "not run" where that is the truth.
- When this file passes 400 lines, move the oldest entries to
  `docs/progress-archive/phase-N.md` in the same commit and leave a one-line
  pointer here.

Template:

```
### TNN Task title
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Outcome: done | partial | blocked
- What changed: the modules, screens or files added or altered, in a few lines
- Verified: command, result; command, result
- UI check: (UI tasks) widths and themes looked at, problems found and fixed,
  critic pass result
- Decisions: D-0NN ..., or none
- Differs from the spec: what and why, or nothing
- Not done: what remains, or nothing
- For the next agent: traps, things that look wrong but are intended, where to
  start
- Ved should know: anything that needs his attention, or nothing
- Commits: first..last short hashes
```
